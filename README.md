## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer and developer passionate about building efficient and innovative solutions. My core expertise lies in Python and JavaScript, with experience in Delphi for legacy systems. I thrive on solving complex problems using algorithms, metaheuristics, and optimization techniques.

Beyond coding, Iâ€™m deeply fascinated by machine learning and deep reinforcement learning, exploring how AI can model and enhance decision-making processes. When Iâ€™m not optimizing code or training models, I work on my love for astronomy and photographyâ€”capturing the beauty of the cosmos and the world through my lens.
